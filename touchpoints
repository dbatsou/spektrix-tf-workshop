Terraform touch points

Goal: become more familiar with how a terraform project is structured, not become experts.

Outcome: azure web app running a public docker image (find one) - use 3.0 from past




1) make intro from slides
2) talk abouts variables
3) resources - data blocks
4) az login 
5) create storage account using the az cli - give em script - ask to change name 
6) terraform init - 
7) because no access to storage container - terraform show - see empty state 
8) add resource group - using variables - prompt them to change the variable file
tenantID - subscription id variables 
9) terraform validate - plan - apply

continue on slides,

Explain difference between resource and data blocks 

State file lease - what it means
Say what happens when terraform fails and lease has not been released
Mention PIM procedure for access to storage accounts 


move on adding app service plan
run plan again

explain that terraform will work out the dependencies between resources 


terraform apply - wait
terraform show for resources

----

make changes to azure manually and then run a plan.

destroy everything
